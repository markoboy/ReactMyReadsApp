# Project Overview

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is a project provided by Udacity with a static example of CSS and HTML without any React code. The puprose of this project is to turn the project into an interactive app by refactoring the static code. The page is showing three bookshelves; **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read** and **Read** shelves, you can move the books between the shelves by a drop down list from each book. You can also access a search page and search for books from a [Books API](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com) provided by Udacity, the books have the same functions as the one shown on the shelves, so you can move books from there to your shelves.

This is a simple project and is made in order to test our skills in React and create a single page app. This is made by using React Components, fetch API to get the books from Books API and React Router Dom to navigate within the page.
